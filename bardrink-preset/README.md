## Bar drink preset (checkboxes)

Checkbox list of drink:* tags for common drinks in establishments serving alcohol, with both alcoholic beverages and some non-alcoholic ones, using only yes and unset, without information on how drinks are served. Intended for rapid drink tagging, especially when using Vespucci, as adding a type of drink is only one click or tap.
<br/>**Still needs work for proper Vespucci compatibility.**
